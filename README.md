# VLC-Tracker
An application that tracks which files you've watched with VLC. This helps keep track of your place in a series.

# Usage
Set your default "open with" file to the included executable. Now, when you open these files instead of going to VLC, you will be presented with the option to "initialize" a directory. Initialized directories will keep track of everything you've watched in that directory. The file will then be passed to VLC and openned normally.

To access your list of initialized directories, simply launch the executable by itself (i.e. with no arguments) and select the "episode" you'd like to watch.

Watched "episodes" can also be reset to unwatched by simply selecting them and pressing the delete key.
